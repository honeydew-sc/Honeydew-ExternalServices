version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ hd-crontab label ./crontab | crontab

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<hd-crontab> takes a label and a file, and it will print to STDOUT
your crontab with that file's contents appended in a section. It does
this idempotently. You'll most likely want to pipe it to your crontab
after reviewing the output:

    $ hd-crontab label ./crontab           # double check that it worked
    $ hd-crontab label ./crontab | crontab # overwrite your crontab
